# Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Simulation under BS model
The code will do the following tasks:
1) Compute the price of a call and put option with the Black Scholes formula.
2) Compute the call and put option Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho).
3) Check for put-call parity.
4) Write a Monte-Carlo pricing engine to price a plain-vanilla call and put option using realizations based on geometric Brownian motion.
